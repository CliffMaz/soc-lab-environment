🛠️ Issue: Windows Event Logs Not Appearing in Splunk
📌 Project Context

Environment:

Windows Server (Splunk Enterprise)

Windows Client (Domain Joined)

Splunk Universal Forwarder

Custom index: wineventlog

Port 9997 configured and active

🚨 Problem

Windows Security Event Logs were not appearing in Splunk Enterprise, even though:

Splunk Universal Forwarder service was running

splunk list forward-server showed Active

_internal logs from the client were visible

Security events were present in Event Viewer

Search query returned no results:

index=wineventlog host=<clienthostname>
🔍 Investigation Steps

Verified forwarder service status (services.msc)

Confirmed active connection using:

splunk list forward-server

Verified receiving port 9997 on Splunk Enterprise

Confirmed _internal logs were being received

Checked inputs.conf configuration

Ran:

splunk list inputstatus

No WinEventLog inputs were listed.

🎯 Root Cause

The configuration file was incorrectly saved as:

inputs.conf.txt

Due to Windows hiding file extensions.

Splunk only loads files ending strictly in:

.conf

As a result, the Universal Forwarder did not load the WinEventLog input configuration.

✅ Resolution

Enabled "File name extensions" in Windows Explorer.

Renamed file from:

inputs.conf.txt

to:

inputs.conf

Restarted Splunk Universal Forwarder:

splunk restart

Verified WinEventLog inputs were loaded:

splunk list inputstatus

Confirmed logs successfully appeared in Splunk Enterprise.

🧠 Lessons Learned

Always verify file extensions on Windows systems.

Use splunk list inputstatus to confirm inputs are loading.

_internal logs can confirm connectivity even if data inputs fail.

Structured troubleshooting prevents unnecessary configuration changes.
